# UNIT TEST

<span>A **unit test** asserts a "unit" behaves as intended</span>
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

<span>A "unit" is typically a single function</span>
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

note: 

- unit: "smallest testable" chunk of code
- a test:
  - executes the unit
  - makes an assertion about the state, retval, etc
